## Chrome Bookmark Viewer

A small side-project born from a failed attempt at building a universal tree-structured JSON viewer. Far from Chrome store worthy state, but I actually use it.

Safety: this extension only reads your Chrome bookmarks, does not modify.

### Installation / Usage

1. Copy the **html**, **js**, and **manifest.json** files into a folder.
2. In Chrome, open **Extensions → Load unpacked**, and select that folder.
3. Use the default **Ctrl+B** hotkey or just create a bookmark pointing to the extension’s page.

### Features

* Fast, simple bookmark browsing
* Search using regular expressions
* Minimal, confusing UI
* Export into standalone html (as archive and works on mobile)

### License

I dunno — just don't kill anyone with it.
